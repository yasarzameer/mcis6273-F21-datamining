    "# ANSWERS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The three things that I found interesting and learned from this podcast that Sanyam says are \n",
    "* Never Give up : \"Its like you just have to have faith that I'm just gonna keep cranking on the details until something interesting happens\".\n",
    "* Stay Motivated : \"Throughout the months of learning a language or the course one should stay motivated enough to continue working on the course because ultimatly they have taken the course to be a HTML designer or full stack devlopper.\"\n",
    "* Upwork : One should start working on a perticular problem to solve it and then can approch a company or person to get into the team showing the work you have already started on rather than starting to work on a problem after you get the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The podcast is good the Host and Sanyam are talking regarding the technical things in a simple manner that a bigginer in Data science can easily relate to and understand what they are talking about. Also basic podcast like this increase the moral of a bigginer. Sanyam conversation is very much relatable in a sense that a biginner is naive and also enthusiastic enough to go through 50 courses online on how to code in python. The one point which I agree with Sanyam is \"Make Progress\". Even if it's little steps in the beginning, make it feel like legitimate progress, not just algorithms and loops and stuff. Small steps of progress eventually are motivational and also fruitful.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Coming from a Non CS back ground listening to the podcast where I hear Sanyam speak technical stuf in a simple and easy way to understand is interesting. And now I'm more interested in a Data Science career. I have been introduced to Kaggle, fast.ai through this podcast that I'm going to look into and learn more about Data Science."
