• What do you wish to accomplish this semester in Data Mining?
Read the documentation for basic Markdown here. Turn in the text .md file not the processed .html. In whatever
you turn in, you must show the use of ALL the following:
• headings (one level is fine), • bullets,
• bold and italics
Again, the content of your document needs to address the question above and it should live in the top level directory of your assignment submission. This part will be graded but no points are awarded for your answer.

# DATA MINING

Data mining is to utilize large or big data, anlyze and process this big data to extract or develop new information which is useful. In this semester with the course Data Mining I'm enthusiastic to learn the different data types representation of data, formats including structured and unstructured; concepts in pre-processing data including scaling, sampling, normalizing, binning and imputing. Also I plan to learn and be good at using data mining tools such as,
* Python
* Anaconda
* Jupyter Notebooks

## Some Important Topics to Learn

**Develop probabilistic models of classification using naïve Bayes**

**understand and develop linear regression models**

*Utilize naïve Bayes in real-world applications*

*understand core social mining algorithms*=
